Title: Some thoughts on chain-of-thought

Abstract: I will share some thoughts to start a discussion on (1) some interesting problems that GPT cannot solve; (2) what neural network and formal language theory have to say about them; (3) what could be done to solve them. The problems all relate to GPT's inability to maintain an internal state. Two existing solutions are recurrence and chain-of-thought prompting. I will explain how these two address different problems, and how neither is really what we want. I won't offer any alternative solutions, but will open up the floor to discussing ideas.
