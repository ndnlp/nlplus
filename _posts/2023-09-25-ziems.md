Title: Explainable Decision Trees

Abstract: Decision trees offer a strong balance between speed, accuracy, and interpretability for tabular data. However, interpreting decision trees in practice is often difficult, as they require background knowledge in machine learning to understand. In this talk, I will discuss my work on exploring how large language models can be used to assist in decision tree explainability as well as how these explanations can be evaluated using auto-generated quiz questions.
