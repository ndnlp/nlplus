NL+ (**N**atural **L**anguage **P**rocessing **Lu**nch **S**eminar) is a weekly event at the University of Notre Dame to build community among faculty and students doing research related to NLP and to build ties with NLP researchers at other universities.

Our faculty sponsors are [David Chiang](https://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang), [Meng Jiang](https://meng-jiang.com), [Collin McMillan](https://www3.nd.edu/~cmc), [John Lalor](https://jplalor.github.io), [Toby Li](https://toby.li), [Walter Scheirer](https://wjscheirer.com), and [Tim Weninger](https://www3.nd.edu/~tweninge/). Our amazing student organizers are Aarohi Srivastava, Abigail Swenor, Mengxia Yu, and Zheng Zhang.

Meetings are usually on Mondays at 12:30pm over lunch.
Roughly once a month, we host outstanding researchers from other universities (faculty and grad students) and industry to present their work.
Other weeks, a speaker from our own community presents a short and informal talk followed by extended Q&A and discussion.
